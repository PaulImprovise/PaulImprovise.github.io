## Requirements

### Browser

One of browsers which supports Web Bluetooth API by default
([Chrome Platform Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5264933985976320),
[Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-bluetooth)):

1. Chrome for desktop 56+
2. Chrome for Android 56+
3. Opera 43+
4. Opera for Android 43+

All this browsers support other necessary features, such as [ES6 classes](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class) and PWA
capabilities ([Web App Manifest](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-app-manifest) and
[Service Workers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers)), so I don't pay attention to it here.
